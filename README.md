# `aws-okta` for Windows
This repository contains build automation for [aws-okta](https://github.com/segmentio/aws-okta), to produce native Windows binaries and MSI installers.

This is not a fork of aws-okta.

The binaries released here are built from the source in the original repository without modification.
